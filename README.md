# Advanced numpy at telecom

We are going to cover:

* recapitulation of numpy array container
* broadcasting
* fancy/boolean indexing
* demo: implementing K-means with numpy
* discussion: pros and cons of broadcasting and vectorisation, alternatives (numba, Cython)
* digression - interfacing with C code
* dtypes and non-homogeneous arrays, object arrays
* strides and shape, stride_tricks

TODO:

* add formative exercises
* add a summative assesment (for example, implement [Quantile normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization))
* add [learning objectives](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/07-design.html)
* decide whether to use jupyter notebook or command line
